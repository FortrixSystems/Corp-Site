# Module Icons (Marketing-Approved)

**Use the approved module icons you received from marketing.** Do not deviate from brand standards (Fortrix Systems Brand Guide §8.2 Iconography, §3.6 Prohibited Use).

## Where to get the icons

Use the **exact** marketing-approved assets (e.g. from the Google Drive or files you were given). Copy them into this folder and rename them as below. The site loads PNG first; if a PNG is missing, it falls back to the SVG placeholder.

## Required filenames (exact)

Place the files in **`public/icons/modules/`** with these names:

| Your file (example) | Save as |
|--------------------|--------|
| `Light_Beacon...`  | `beacon-light.png` |
| `Dark_Beacon...` or `Inverse_Beacon...` | `beacon-dark.png` |
| `Light_Ledger...`  | `ledger-light.png` |
| `Dark_Ledger...` or `Inverse_Ledger...` | `ledger-dark.png` |
| `Light_Draw...`    | `draw-light.png` |
| `Dark_Draw...` or `Inverse_Draw...` | `draw-dark.png` |
| `Light_Retail...`  | `retail-light.png` |
| `Dark_Retail...` or `Inverse_Retail...` | `retail-dark.png` |
| `Light_Connect...` | `connect-light.png` |
| `Dark_Connect...` or `Inverse_Connect...` | `connect-dark.png` |
| `Light_Insight...` | `insight-light.png` |
| `Dark_Insight...` or `Inverse_Insight...` | `insight-dark.png` |

**All 6 modules:** Beacon, Ledger, Draw, Retail, Connect, Insight — each needs a **light** and **dark** file (12 PNGs total). All are in place.

## Brand application (do not change)

- **Light** variant: used on **light backgrounds** (white, Grey 100) — e.g. modules list.
- **Dark** variant: used on **dark backgrounds** (Deep Navy #14222F, Charcoal #0F1316) — e.g. module page hero.

Icons are not stretched, skewed, rotated, or recolored (Brand §3.6). Sizing: list 40px, hero 56px.
